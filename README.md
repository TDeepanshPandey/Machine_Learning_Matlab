# Machine Learning (Matlab)

I have done Machine Learning course offered from Stanford University by Andrew NG. The projects are programming assignments that need to be done in Matlab every week.

**Note - Please don't copy the assignments. The course is really good and can help you to build your core concepts of machine learning.**
